# Hiking Vlog Guide

Information on platforms, content ownership, and sponsorships for a hiking vlog.

## YouTube vs Custom Website

| Factor | YouTube | Custom Website |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Audience reach** | Built-in discovery, 2B+ users | You drive all traffic yourself |
| **Cost** | Free | Hosting + domain (~$100-200/yr) |
| **Video hosting** | Free, unlimited | Expensive (Vimeo, Wistia, or self-host) |
| **Monetization** | Ad revenue, sponsorships | Harder without audience first |
| **SEO** | YouTube is the #2 search engine | Harder to rank for video |
| **Effort** | Just upload and optimize | Build + maintain + upload elsewhere |
| **Ownership** | YouTube owns the platform | You own everything |

---

## Content Ownership: What YouTube Actually "Owns"

| What | Reality |
|------|---------|
| **Your videos** | You retain copyright — YouTube gets a license to display/distribute |
| **Your channel** | They can terminate it (rare, but happens) |
| **Monetization** | They control ad rates, can demonetize |
| **Algorithm** | They decide who sees your content |
| **Relationship with viewers** | They own the platform, not your subscriber list |

**You own the content. They own the platform and the audience relationship.**

The real risk isn't ownership — it's dependency. If YouTube bans your channel or changes the algorithm, you lose access to your audience.

## Self-Hosted Video Costs

If you want full ownership:

| Option | Cost | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Vimeo Pro** | $20/mo | 4TB storage, good quality |
| **Bunny.net** | ~$5-20/mo | Pay per GB, cheaper for small libraries |
| **Cloudflare Stream** | $5/mo + $1/1000 min | Good for scaling |
| **Self-host (AWS/Backblaze)** | Variable | Technical, can get expensive |

A 10-minute 4K hike video = 2-5 GB. Weekly posting adds up fast.

## Recommended Hybrid Approach

Best of both worlds:

1. **YouTube** — Free hosting, discovery, reach
2. **Custom website** — You control brand, email list, written content
3. **Backup your videos** — Keep originals on your own drives
4. **Build email list** — The one thing you truly own

If YouTube ever disappears, you still have:
- Your original files
- Your email subscribers
- Your website

## Platform Recommendation by Goal

| Goal | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| **Passion project** | Custom site makes sense, post what you want, no algorithm pressure |
| **Wants audience/income** | YouTube is almost required for video discovery |
| **Sharing with others** | Start with YouTube, simple and free |

---

## Starting Simple

1. **Film your next hike** — Phone is fine
2. **Post to YouTube** — Unlisted or public, doesn't matter
3. **Share with friends/family** — See if you enjoy the process
4. **Decide later** — Website, monetization, etc. can come after you know you like it

# Getting Sponsors

## Why Companies Sponsor People

| What They Want | Why |
|----------------|-----|
| **Reach** | Your audience sees their brand |
| **Content** | Photos/videos they can use |
| **Credibility** | Your reputation reflects on them |

They're buying marketing. No audience = no value to them.

---

## What Sponsors Look For

| Factor | What Gets Sponsored | Starting Out |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Followers** | 10K-100K+ | Starting from 0 |
| **Engagement** | Active community | None yet |
| **Track record** | Consistent content | No content yet |
| **Professionalism** | Media kit, past work | Nothing to show |

Big brands like REI get thousands of requests. They sponsor people who already have proven audiences.

---

## Realistic Options Without an Audience

### 1. Self-Fund
Go on the hike, document it well, use that content to build your platform. Great footage becomes your portfolio.

### 2. Smaller/Local Brands
Lesser-known gear companies are hungrier for exposure:
- Local outdoor shops
- Smaller gear brands (not Patagonia/REI)
- Trail food companies
- Sock or accessory brands

Pitch: "I'll feature your product in my content in exchange for [gear/discount]."

### 3. Affiliate Instead of Sponsorship
No upfront money, but:
- Sign up for REI affiliate program
- Link gear you already own in your content
- Earn commission if people buy

### 4. Crowdfund the Trip
If you have a community (even small):
- Patreon or Ko-fi
- "Support my hike, get behind-the-scenes content"

## The Real Path to Sponsorship

1. **Do the hike anyway** — Create great content
2. **Build an audience** — Post consistently for 6-12 months
3. **Hit 5-10K engaged followers** — Now brands notice
4. **Reach out with proof** — "I have X followers, Y engagement, here's my past work"
5. **Start with small brands** — Build relationships, get testimonials
6. **Level up** — REI, Patagonia, etc. come later

Most sponsored hikers built their audience for 1-3 years before anyone paid them.

## Sponsorship Timeline Reality

| Stage | Timeframe | What Happens |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **Year 1** | 0-12 months | Create content, find your style, build small audience |
| **Year 2** | 12-24 months | Consistent posting, 1K-10K followers, small brand interest |
| **Year 3+** | 24+ months | Larger following, bigger brands reach out, real income possible |

## Key Insight

The creators who burn out are usually the ones who optimized for money before they knew if they even liked making content.

Start with passion. Sponsorships follow audiences, and audiences follow authentic content.
