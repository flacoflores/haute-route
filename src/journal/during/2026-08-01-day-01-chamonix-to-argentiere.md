Woke up at 6am in Chamonix to a perfect view of Mont Blanc glowing pink in the morning light. After a coffee and croissant at the hotel, I shouldered my pack and started walking.

## The Trail

The first day is intentionally easy — a warm-up stage that follows the valley floor before climbing gently to Argentière. The Arve river valley was lush and green, with wildflowers everywhere. I passed through the hamlet of Les Praz and could hear cowbells echoing off the slopes above.

The final climb up to Argentière was the first real taste of what's to come — switchbacks through forest, gaining elevation steadily. Nothing extreme, but enough to remind my legs what they signed up for.

## At the Gîte

Arrived at Gîte Le Belvedere around 2pm. Claimed a bunk, showered (luxury!), and spent the afternoon on the terrace watching the Argentière glacier across the valley.

Dinner was tartiflette — a Savoyard potato and cheese dish — with local wine. Met a couple from the Netherlands doing the same route. We compared gear lists over dessert.

> Day one in the books. Thirteen to go. The mountains are patient, and so am I.
