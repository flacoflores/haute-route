For years I've stared at photos of the Swiss Alps and thought *someday*. This summer, someday becomes a date on the calendar.

## The Draw

The Walker's Haute Route is one of Europe's classic long-distance treks. It connects two of the most iconic peaks in the Alps — Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn — through 180 km of high mountain terrain across 14 stages.

What makes it special isn't just the distance. It's the variety: you pass through French-speaking valleys, cross into Switzerland, traverse high alpine passes above 2,500m, walk alongside glaciers, and descend into tiny villages where life hasn't changed much in decades.

## The Plan

I'll be hiking the route over 14 days starting August 1st, 2026. The plan is to stay in mountain huts (refuges and cabanes) along the way — no camping, no heavy tent to carry.

I'm building this site to share the journey with friends and family. During the hike, I'll post daily updates from the trail — short journal entries with photos, written from whatever hut I land at each evening.

## What's Next

Over the coming months, I'll be posting about gear choices, training, route planning, and logistics. Follow along as the plan comes together.
