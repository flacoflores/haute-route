One of the best things about a hut-to-hut trek is the lighter pack. No tent, no sleeping bag, no stove, no cooking gear. But you still need to be prepared for high-altitude weather that can change in minutes.

## The Philosophy

My target is a base weight under 6 kg (not counting food and water). Since huts provide meals and beds with blankets, I only need a silk liner, a change of clothes, and rain/cold weather layers.

## Key Decisions

**Trail runners over boots.** The Salomon X Ultra 4 gives me enough grip and support without the weight. Already have 200 km on them — well broken in.

**Merino everything.** Three days of wear before it smells, dries quickly, and temperature regulates well. Worth the cost.

**Trekking poles.** Carbon Z-poles that fold down small. Non-negotiable for the steep descents on this route — some days have 1,200m+ of descent.

## The Test

Next weekend I'm doing an overnight shakedown hike with the full kit. The goal is to identify anything I've overpacked or forgotten before it's too late to adjust.
