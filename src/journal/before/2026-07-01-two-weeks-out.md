excerpt: "Final preparations — hut reservations confirmed, training tapered, bags almost packed."
phase: "Before"

One month until departure. The excitement is real and so are the nerves.

## Reservations

All 13 nights of accommodation are booked. Most huts required a phone call (some of these places are refreshingly analog), but a few accepted email. Deposits paid. Demi-pension (dinner + breakfast) at every stop — that's the way to do it.

## Training

The last four months of training have gone well. Weekly elevation hikes with a loaded pack, plus running for cardio base. I've been averaging about 1,000m of climbing per week, which should have me ready for the bigger days on the route.

This week I'm tapering — light walks, stretching, and rest. No point in arriving tired.

## Logistics

- Flights booked: Geneva in, Geneva out
- Train from Geneva to Chamonix on July 31st (arrive evening, stay in town)
- Train from Zermatt back to Geneva on August 15th
- Travel insurance with mountain rescue coverage confirmed

## This Site

I've tested the mobile posting workflow a few times now. Write a markdown file on my phone, commit and push, and the site updates within a minute. It works. Daily updates should be manageable even after a long day on the trail.

Next post: Day 1, from the trail.
