# Haute Route Content Plan

Content capture guide for Chamonix to Zermatt thru-hike (July-August 2026).

---

## Golden Rule

**10-15 minutes of intentional filming per day, max.**

You're there to hike. Content is secondary.

## Daily Capture Checklist

Do these each day (5-10 min total):

| Shot | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Morning start** | 10-sec clip leaving hut/camp, date & location voiceover |
| **Trail POV** | 30-60 sec walking shot (GoPro or phone) |
| **One "wow" moment** | The view that stops you — let it breathe, 20-30 sec |
| **End of day arrival** | Reaching the hut, village, or camp |
| **Quick journal** | 30-60 sec talking to camera — how you feel, what happened |

That's it. Don't overthink it.

## Key Moments to NOT Miss

| Day/Stage | What to Capture |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Day 1 - Chamonix** | Start line energy, Mont Blanc in background, "here we go" moment |
| **First big col** | The climb, the pass sign, the view from top |
| **Mid-trip (~Day 6-7)** | Honest check-in: fatigue, doubts, why you're still going |
| **Hardest day** | Don't hide the struggle — authenticity wins |
| **Iconic spots** | Any glaciers, lakes, ridgelines — the poster shots |
| **Final approach to Zermatt** | Matterhorn reveal, emotions arriving |
| **Zermatt finish** | Celebrate, reflect on camera |

---

## Shot Types to Mix In

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Wide landscape** | Phone on tripod, you walk into frame |
| **POV walking** | GoPro chest or hand mount |
| **Time-lapse** | Clouds moving over peaks (phone propped up, 5 min) |
| **Close-ups** | Boots on trail, hands on rock, food at hut |
| **Talking head** | Daily journal, direct to camera |
| **Candid** | Other hikers (ask permission), hut life, meals |

---

## Audio Notes (Secret Weapon)

When too tired to film, just **record voice memos**:
- What you're feeling
- What happened that day
- Ideas for the video

These become voiceover gold in editing.

---

## Gear Loadout

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Phone** | Main camera, good enough for 90% of shots |
| **GoPro (optional)** | POV, weather-resistant, small |
| **Gorillapod or mini tripod** | For solo shots, time-lapses |
| **Power bank** | 20,000mAh minimum for multi-day |
| **Extra storage** | Cloud backup at huts with WiFi, or extra SD cards |
| **Lens wipe cloth** | Sweat and rain will hit your lens |

## Sample Day

> **6:00 AM** — Wake up in hut, film 10-sec "good morning from X hut"
>
> **6:30 AM** — Heading out, quick shot of trail start
>
> **10:00 AM** — Reach a col, 30-sec pan of the view
>
> **12:00 PM** — Lunch break, voice memo about how you're feeling
>
> **4:00 PM** — Arrive at next hut, film arrival
>
> **8:00 PM** — 60-sec journal entry before bed

**Total filming: ~10 minutes. Rest of the day: just hike.**

## Post-Trip Content Options

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Full documentary (15-30 min)** | The whole journey, story arc |
| **Day-by-day series** | Episode per stage (5-10 min each) |
| **Highlights reel (3-5 min)** | Quick cut, music-driven, shareable |
| **Gear review** | What worked, what didn't |
| **Trail guide** | Blog post with tips, hut info, route beta |
| **Short clips** | Instagram/TikTok reels from best moments |

Capture once, repurpose later.

## Story Arc (For Editing Later)

| Act | Content |
|-----|---------|
| **Beginning** | Chamonix start, excitement, fresh legs, the dream |
| **Middle** | The grind, fatigue sets in, doubts, weather challenges |
| **Turning point** | A hard day, a moment of clarity, why you keep going |
| **Climax** | Final push, Matterhorn reveal, emotions |
| **Resolution** | Zermatt arrival, reflection, what you learned |

This structure makes the footage into a story, not just pretty shots.

## Pre-Trip To-Do

- [ ] Book hut reservations (peak season!)
- [ ] Confirm route variant (walker's vs glacier)
- [ ] Test camera gear on a local hike
- [ ] Practice talking to camera (feels awkward at first)
- [ ] Download offline maps
- [ ] Get travel insurance (covers evacuation)
- [ ] Charge all batteries, test power bank

## Notes

- Don't stress about "content" — capture moments, edit later
- Bad weather days = some of the best footage
- Talk about real feelings, not just scenery
- Viewers connect with struggle more than summit glory
- Back up footage whenever you have WiFi
